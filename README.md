```

The MATLAB implementation of the atlas-based approach can be found in the subdirectory ['atlas-based-segmentation'](https://github.com/lruthotto/ChiariProject/tree/main/atlas-based-segmentation).

The PyTorch implementation of the neural-network-based approach is contained in the subdirectory ['convolutional-neural-network'](https://github.com/lruthotto/ChiariProject/tree/main/convolutional-neural-network).
